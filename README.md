# MERN
This is my attempt at refactoring this MERN website.
-------------------------------------------------------
I was suppose to deploy this to heroku but could not get it to deploy after hours of troubleshooting with
the teaching staff and personla troubleshooting. I had to manually drag and drop every file into the Githib repository in order to show at least
my attempt at refactoring the code. To be honest this whole assignment was a fiasco for me, due to the fact I could not even deploy this to Heroku within 
the time to submit all work by the 23rd of Nov. As of writing this it is the 23rd of Nov. and I have to submit something. I do apologize for the incorrect way of uploading this, but 
I was left with no choice as the teaching staff could not reach me in time to solve this issue.
The code I refactored was the Model's folder in Server folder, and I added a schema folder with a resolver and typeDef to try and get the website to work. Unfortunately I kept running into 
the error that `model` is not a valid type within the array `savedBooks`. I will try and resolve this in my personal time.
